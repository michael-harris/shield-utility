# Shield Configuration Utility

A sophisticated web-based calculator for optimizing shield configurations in your game. Features a dark theme UI with two calculation modes and real-time visualization.

## Features

### 🎯 Dual Calculation Modes
- **Value → Components**: Input desired shield stats and get optimal component configuration
- **Components → Value**: Select components and see real-time shield statistics

### 🌟 Key Capabilities
- **Smart Optimization**: Automatically finds the most CPU-efficient configurations
- **Real-time Updates**: Live stat calculations as you adjust components
- **Constraint Handling**: Supports CPU limits, power limits, and component restrictions
- **Visual Feedback**: Radar chart visualization of shield performance
- **Dark Theme**: Beautiful cyberpunk-inspired dark UI using Bulma CSS

### 🛠️ Component Database
Complete database of all shield components including:
- **Shield Generators**: Compact, Standard, and Advanced
- **Fusion Reactors**: Small and Large variants
- **Shield Extenders**: Basic, Improved, and Advanced (Capacitors & Chargers)
- **Blocks**: Steel, Hardened Steel, Combat Steel, and XenoSteel

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No installation required - runs entirely in the browser

### Usage

1. **Open the Calculator**
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or serve from a local HTTP server for best experience

2. **Value → Components Mode**
   - Enter your desired shield capacity and/or recharge rate
   - Input any existing blocks you already have
   - Set constraints (CPU limit, power limit, etc.)
   - Click "Calculate Optimal Configuration"
   - View the recommended component list

3. **Components → Value Mode**
   - Select your shield generator
   - Add fusion reactors if desired
   - Choose shield extenders (capacitors boost capacity, chargers boost recharge)
   - Add any blocks you have
   - Watch live stats update in real-time

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter`: Calculate optimal configuration
- `Ctrl/Cmd + 1`: Switch to Value → Components mode
- `Ctrl/Cmd + 2`: Switch to Components → Value mode
- `Escape`: Close results panel

## Technical Details

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **UI Framework**: Bulma CSS with custom dark theme
- **Charts**: Chart.js for radar visualization
- **Icons**: Font Awesome
- **Build**: Standalone - no Node.js or build process required

### Component Data
All component stats are stored in `js/data.js` and match the reference documentation. The calculator includes:
- Accurate capacity, recharge, power, and CPU values
- Component limits and tier restrictions
- Efficiency calculations for optimization
- Image paths for visual representation

### Optimization Algorithm
The optimizer uses multiple strategies:
1. **Balanced**: Optimizes for both capacity and recharge simultaneously
2. **Capacity First**: Prioritizes reaching capacity target, then adjusts recharge
3. **Recharge First**: Prioritizes reaching recharge target, then adjusts capacity
4. **Efficiency**: Uses most CPU-efficient components first

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support
- **Edge**: Full support
- **Mobile**: Responsive design works on tablets and phones

## Contributing

The calculator is built with modularity in mind. Key areas for enhancement:
- Additional optimization algorithms in `optimizer.js`
- New UI features in `ui.js`
- Component database updates in `data.js`
- Visual improvements in `styles.css`
