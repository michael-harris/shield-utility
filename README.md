## Features Overview

### Two Powerful Modes

The utility offers two complementary approaches to shield design:

- **Shield Calculator**: Specify your requirements and let the optimizer find the best configuration
- **Shield Explorer**: Experiment with components manually and see real-time performance feedback

Both modes support the full range of RE2 shield components including generators, extenders, fusion reactors, power generators, shield blocks, and crew bonuses.

## Shield Calculator Mode

The Shield Calculator is your go-to tool when you have specific performance requirements. Tell it what shield stats you need, and it will find the most efficient configuration to achieve them.

### Capabilities

- **Target-based Optimization**: Specify desired shield capacity and/or recharge rate
- **Multiple Optimization Strategies**:
  - **CPU-Efficiency**: Minimize CPU usage while meeting your targets (with fusion reactor limits)
  - **Max Balanced**: Maximize shield capacity with balanced recharge rate
  - **Max Capacity**: Achieve the highest possible shield capacity with positive recharge
  - **Max Recharge**: Maximize capacity with â‰¤15 second full recharge time
- **Advanced Constraint System**: Set limits on CPU, power, generator types, extender quantities, and reactor usage
- **Consider Power Usage Option**: Choose whether to include power generation components in optimization
- **Block & Crew Integration**: Include existing shield blocks and crew bonuses in calculations
- **Export & Share**: Generate detailed HTML reports of your optimized builds
- **Edit in Explorer**: Transfer calculator results to Explorer mode for further tweaking

### Instructions

1. **Set Your Performance Goals** (Optional)
   - Enter desired shield capacity in HP (leave blank to maximize)
   - Enter desired recharge rate in HP/s (leave blank to maximize)
   - For CPU-Efficiency strategy, targets are required

2. **Choose Your Optimization Strategy**
   - **CPU-Efficiency**: Best for builds with limited CPU (uses realistic fusion reactor limits)
   - **Max Balanced**: Best for general-purpose builds seeking optimal balance
   - **Max Capacity**: Best for tank builds that prioritize survivability
   - **Max Recharge**: Best for sustained combat with fast shield recovery

3. **Configure Constraints** (Optional)
   - Set CPU and power limits based on your vessel's capabilities
   - Restrict generator types if you have preferences
   - Limit extender quantities for balanced builds
   - Control fusion reactor usage (default limits are realistic for most builds)
   - Use "Consider Power Usage" to choose shield-only or full power optimization

4. **Include Existing Components** (Optional)

### Instructions

1. **Select Your Shield Generator**
   - Choose from Compact, Standard, or Advanced Shield Generator
   - This is required and enables all other component selections
   - Higher tiers provide more capacity and recharge but cost more CPU and power

2. **Add Power Sources**
   - **Fusion Reactors**: Provide both power generation and recharge bonuses
     - Small Fusion Reactor: +250 HP/s recharge, 300kW power, 100k CPU (max 4)

     - Improved Large Generator: 25kW power, 25k CPU
     - Advanced Large Generator: 100kW power, 50k CPU

3. **Fine-tune with Shield Extenders**
   - **Capacitors**: Increase shield capacity but decrease recharge rate
   - **Chargers**: Increase shield recharge rate, but decrease capacity
   - Each tier has quantity limits: Advanced (4), Improved (6), Basic (8)
   - Mix and match within tier limits to achieve desired balance

4. **Add Shield Blocks and Crew** (Optional)
   - **Shield Blocks**: Direct capacity bonuses that scale with block tier
   - **Shield Technicians**: Provide both capacity (+2,000 HP) and recharge (+75 HP/s) bonuses
   - Up to 16 shield technicians can be assigned

5. **Monitor Real-time Performance**
   - Watch statistics update instantly as you make changes
   - Use the radar chart to visualize balance between capacity, recharge, CPU efficiency, and power efficiency
   - Check for warnings about invalid configurations or exceeded component limits
   - Export successful builds for documentation or sharing
